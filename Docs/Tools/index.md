# Tools

[Return to Table of Contents](/README.md)

This is a recommended set of tools. They are by no means required but they can be useful for development.

## **MongoDB Compass**

<https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass>
A useful tool for directly reading/writing to the mongoDB database. Primarily useful for backend developers

## **Node Version Manager**

[**POSIX/UNIX version**](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/tree/v0.35.3)  
[**Windows Version**](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)  
For team members that need to switch between different versions of NodeJS, nvm is a really useful tool

## **VSCode**

<https://code.visualstudio.com/>  
Just a good, well rounded, IDE. VSCode has a massive marketplace for extensions that can increase your productivity. Here are some extensions are team members use (feel free to add to this list):

### **Extensions:**

#### **ESLint**

[**VSCode Marketplace Link**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)  
Each Pull Request has to pass lint rules, without a linter this can be a pain.

[**Prettier**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) is a good alternative to this, we do have dev dependencies that allow .prettierrc files to be used by ESLint, for the most part these are interchangable.

#### **Git Blame**

Displays the author, commit, and time for each line of code.
